# ðŸ¤– GitHub MCP â€“ Natural Language Command Interface

GitHub MCP is a lightweight server that enables you to interact with GitHub using natural language prompts. It uses a local LLM client and a FastAPI server to interpret your commands and call GitHubâ€™s REST API behind the scenes.

##  Features

You can perform the following operations on your GitHub repositories by typing simple commands:

##  How It Works

- `llm_client.py`: Acts as the natural language interface, sending parsed commands to the MCP server.
- `llm_parser.py`: Parses natural language input into a structured MCP payload.
